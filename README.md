NLP for sentiment analysis on hotel reviews

This project tries to solve several problems from the hotel industry, particularly those related to their guests, knowing their source countries and their preferences. Another important challenge for a hotel is to allocate the right amount of their resources according to the expected number of guests during each season, and targetting their advertising campaigns only to the right type of guest. Last but not least, every hotel manager should try to understand the hotel' strong and weak points by listening to what their guests have to say in their reviews.
